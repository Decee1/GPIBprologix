# GPIBprologix
Very simple GPIB driver for Prologix USB-GPIB adapter

I made this Library to support a Chinese copy of a Prologix USB-GPIB adapter i bought that was made to support Prologix.
I also designed it to be as easy as PyVisa so it uses the same names for It's defines, classes and such
Supports multiple GPIB instruments on a single USB-GPIB adapter. 

Installertion:
Clone git
Put folder somewhere on computer
Open terminal and navigate into folder
Type in "pip install ."
